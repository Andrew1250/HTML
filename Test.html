A young soldier, Nod (Josh Hutcherson), filled with independence, decides to quit, much to the ire of the no-nonsense Leaf Men leader, Ronin (Colin Farrell), who wishes for Nod to learn about teamwork. The queen of the forest, Queen Tara (Beyoncé Knowles), decides choose an heir to her thrown and goes out to a field of leaf pods, guarded by a laid-back slug named Mub (Aziz Ansari) and an uptight snail named Grub (Chris ODowd), who wishes to become a leaf man, to set her magic on to choose. When she chooses, the Boggans attack. In the midst of the attack, Mandrake's son and lead general, Dagda (Blake Anderson), is killed by Ronin, but Tara is shot by Mandrake beforehand.

She tells M.K. to take the pod to a Glowworm named Nim Galuu (Steven Tyler) before she dies. After meeting Ronin and the Leafmen, along with Mub and Grub, a confused and scared MK joins them. Ronin discovers that Nod has entered a race against other creatures and bugs on birds. He goes back on a deal with a tough fog named Bufo (Pitbull). Before Bufo and his goons can kill Nod, Ronin intervenes and orders the goons to leave. A reluctant Nod joins him, M.K, Mub, and Grub after hearing about Tara's death. They eventually find Nim Galuu, who is a showman and keeper of magic scrolls that tell what has occured during the times, in a tree. After learning about Tara's death, he leads the group down to the scrolls, where M.K. discovers Tara's brief message before shrinking her, and a mensage that will get her back to notmal saze When Ronin leas es. Nod takes MK on a deer ride and they fall in lo.e Mandrake (who Bufo feat full: teseals the location of the pod to as he ov erheard from Ronin and Nod) arrives and kidnaps and imprisons Mub and Grub. along with the pod which he hopes to bloom in darkness to destroy the forest. To get into Boggan territory undiscov ered, MK, Nod, and Ronin set out to Bomba's house to get some disguises, where MK learns that her father is what the Leafmen call a "stomper" and have been leadıng Bomba off ther trail After getting the disguises, Ozzie (who earlier returns to Bomba's house) sees MK and chases her, catching Bomba's attention He sees the group and catches MK but faints after seeing her. Before leaving, MK. marks wear the Leafimen territory is on one of Bomba's maps with a red push pin When they reach the Boggan land, which is a wasteland of dead trees, Ronin distracts the Boggans while M.K. and Nod rescue Mub, Grub, and the pod. They are eventually found out by Mandrake, who summons the Boggans to stop them. MK, Nod, Mub, and Grub escape alive, but Ronin sacrifices himself to ensure their escape. Before the full moon can sprout the pod at Nim Galuu's place via light, Mandrake's bats block the light, causng the pod to sprout in daskness. When the Leafmen set out to fight the Boggans (with Grub unsuccessfully joining them) MK. sets out to get ber father for assistance, but an exasperated Bomba (after regaining consciousness) decides to give up on what he has been doing to find his daughter and shuts ofall his cameras, believing that he dida't really see M.K and that he's been insane all his years, but changes his mind when he sees the push-pin in his map. After locating MK, Bomba is overjoyed to see that be has been right and when he follows MK. to Nim Galuu's, be (with M.K's persuasion) uses his iPod to make bat sounds, causing the bats to follow Bomba. Meanwhile, Mub and Nim Galuu try to stop Mandrake from reaching the pod, but are unsuccessful. Just then, Ronin appears, bearing scars and bruises from Boggans. Mandrake manages to outdo him, but Ronin is defended by Nod, who earlier finally understands the importance of teamwork. Before Mandrake can obtain his victory, the moonlight takes over the pod before it blooms in darkness, causing it to bloom in light and it sends Mandrake to be imprisoned in a tree. It also heals the forest after much damage.
